     I remember that summer quite well and yet<br> it all went by in a blur.
	 Some of the lessons I learned, I'll keep<br> with me forever, somethings can never go unseen, some memories leave wounds so deep
	 they never heal.<br> I'll never forget the first time I saw the clown.
	 <br>I was in my room, I had been snacthed from my sleep by a cold hand,<br>
	 I looked at the alarm clock sitting on the night stand, 3:02&nbsp;a.m.
	 <br> as I gathered my senses, I noticed an odd shape in the corner of the room,
	 darker than the dark.
